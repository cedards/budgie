# User Profile

I have expenses and savings goals that I need to allocate funds for.

I pay most of my expenses from a credit card, but some directly from my bank account

My income goes into my bank account

My expense targets may change over time, and this should usually not be retroactive (when my rent increases,
I only need to be targeting the new value going forward, not from the beginning of time)

Most of my budgeting is for recurring expenses
