I have expenses and savings goals that I need to allocate funds for.

It would be nice to know how far in advance I have "funded" my budget at any given point in time.

It would be nice to know projected expenses for a given month

It would be nice to know historical expenses for a given time period

I pay most of my expenses from a credit card, but some directly from my bank account

My income goes into my bank account

I need to be able to allocate funds in my bank account to expenses that will be paid from my credit card

My expense targets may change over time, and this should usually not be retroactive (when my rent increases,
I only need to be targeting the new value going forward, not from the beginning of time)

Most of my budgeting is for recurring expenses
